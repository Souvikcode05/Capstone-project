# Project Summary
With the rapid expansion of the streaming industry, Amazon Prime Video has become one of the leading platforms, offering a vast and diverse content library. This project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the available content to uncover trends, regional availability, and viewer preferences, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimizing content curation and audience engagement.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises two key files

- titles.csv: Contains over 9,000 unique titles with information such as show type, genres, production countries, IMDb ratings, and release years.

- credits.csv: Includes more than 124,000 records of actors and directors, mapping them to their respective titles.

The dataset includes both categorical (e.g., genres, production countries) and numerical (e.g., IMDb scores, runtime) attributes, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of Amazon Prime's content library.

# Analysis Approach
The project follows a structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach to uncover trends and patterns within the dataset. Various aspects such as content type distribution, regional production trends, genre popularity, and IMDb ratings are analyzed. The analysis is visualized through different types of charts and graphs, providing clear insights into the data.

# Business Objective
